# MUSI-6201-Project
Real-time Valence/Arousal Detection

To do:
1. Split audio into chucks for dataset creation
  - 0.5s
  - 1s
  - 2s
  - 4s
  - 8s
  - 16s
  - Transfer learning size
2. Determine size per set (75 songs train, 25 songs test)
3. Generate randomized training/test sets.

## Bigger Idea
Consider a combination of our smaller-time-scale model in parallel the transfer learning approach
